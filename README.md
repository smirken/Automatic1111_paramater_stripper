Really simple script.
It just read the PNG files in the current director, pops (removes) The 'parameters', and puts a copy in a "Parameters" directory

Feel free to give me hints etc, I'm a newb, but I'm going to try and be a helpful newb.

Note this version is very basic, but better than nothing, and does what I need today.
